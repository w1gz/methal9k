# Motivation #

This is a good exercise for learning more about Elixir, Erlang and
OTP. Furthermore, Hal greatly benefits from the features provided by OTP:
GenServer, Supervisor or even Hot code loading.


# Installation #

Basic requirements:
- Erlang (>= OTP 18)
- Elixir (latest stable branch, ideally)


# Improvements #

If you feel something is wrong with the way Hal is done, I welcome any
suggestion, criticism or contribution.
